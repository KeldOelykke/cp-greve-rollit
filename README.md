Micro bit electronic game - inspired by old wooden ball labyrinth game

Just copy paste source code into the JavaScript tab of the Microbit editor (https://makecode.microbit.org/#).

NOTE! The source code is too big to publish and share via the Editor.
NOTE! I found that FireFox handled this code size in the Microbit editor better than the other web browsers.

Have fun!
