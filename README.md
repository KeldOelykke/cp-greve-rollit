# cp-greve-rollit
Micro bit electronic game - inspired by old wooden ball labyrinth game

# Background
This project was done with aid from kids and adults in Coding Pirates, Greve, Denmark.
Coding Pirates (https://codingpirates.dk/) show kids how they can be creative with IT and have fun while doing it. 

# Code
Just copy paste source code into the JavaScript tab of the Microbit editor (https://makecode.microbit.org/#).

NOTE! The source code is too big to publish and share via the Editor.
NOTE! I found that FireFox handled this code size in the Microbit editor better than the other web browsers.

# Always
Have fun together!
